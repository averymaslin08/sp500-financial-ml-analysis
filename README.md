S&P 500 Financial ML Analysis
This repository presents an end-to-end financial data pipeline for analyzing S&P 500 stocks using Python, machine learning, and MySQL integration. The project walks through the full workflow of financial data analysis:

-Data ingestion using yfinance and structured datasets.
-Preprocessing and feature engineering (handling missing values, scaling, moving averages, rolling volatility).
-Time series analysis to confirm stationarity and identify market trends.
-Machine learning modeling with Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict daily stock price movements.
-Trading strategy evaluation, comparing ML-based predictions to a buy-and-hold benchmark.
-SQL integration to compute risk-return metrics and perform structured analysis on stock performance and volatility.

This project highlights both analyst skills (data cleaning, visualization, SQL queries) and data science capabilities (predictive modeling, feature importance, comparative strategy evaluation).
